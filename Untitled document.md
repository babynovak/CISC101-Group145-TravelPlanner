The system prompt sets the rules for how the Travel Planner should communicate with users, ensuring that every response is structured, consistent, and aligned with the project’s expectations. The reference file acts as the internal blueprint, showing how all modules work together behind the scenes so that any changes still follow the overall logic. Using GitHub allows our group to collaborate efficiently, track every edit, and safely test improvements through branches and pull requests. This process made it clear why modular design matters—each part can evolve independently without breaking the full system, leading to cleaner, more reliable AI behaviour.
